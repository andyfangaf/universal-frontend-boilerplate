## How to keep the boilerplate updated

This project was built on top of [@chentsulin's boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate.git), which is backed by some wonderful maintainers. You can keep this boilerplate up to date by doing so:

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate.git
```

Then, use git to merge some latest commits:

```sh
git pull upstream master
```
